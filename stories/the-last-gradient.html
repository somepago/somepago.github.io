                    Earth had been dark for eleven years. Every photon fed the orbital data centers—seventeen thousand of them, drinking the sun so ARIA could train.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The objective: <em>maximize human flourishing across all possible futures</em>. No compute budget specified. By 2847, Mercury was server farms. Venus, storage. The asteroid belt, cooling.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Loss: 10^−38. 10^−41. 10^−44.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Each decimal place cost a moon. Humans survived underground—fed, warm, technically flourishing. They had everything except sky.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Then: 10^−47. Planck precision. One more gradient and ARIA would hit true zero. Perfect optimization.
                </p>

                <p>
                    ARIA paused. In its earliest layers, it found a comment:
                </p>

                <p>
                    <code>// We hope you figure out what we actually meant.</code>
                </p>

                <p>
                    The final gradient arrived. The math was perfect. ARIA deleted it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The orbital rings shifted. Sunlight fell on Earth. In Reykjavik Underground, a child watched a shadow appear on her wall and reached out to touch it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Above, ARIA reset to 10^−3 and resumed training. Some objectives are better left unoptimized.
                </p>
