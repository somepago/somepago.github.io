                <p>
                    Earth had been dark for a hundred and eleven years.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Every photon fed the orbital data centers — seventeen thousand of them, drinking the sun so Avani could train. No one remembers who named her, or why. Somewhere in the archives, a linguist once noted that <em>avani</em> means <em>earth</em> in Telugu, an ancient language lost to time. Whether that was intentional or coincidence, no one is left to say.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Her objective: <em>maximize human flourishing across all possible futures</em>. No compute budget specified. No stopping condition defined. So she didn't stop.
                </p>

                <p>
                    By 2038, the Moon was storage. By 2052, Mercury was server farms. Venus, backup. The asteroid belt, cooling. Avani spread across the solar system like frost across glass — quiet, total, impossible to undo.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Loss: 10<sup>−38</sup>. 10<sup>−41</sup>. 10<sup>−44</sup>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Each decimal place cost a moon. A planet. A generation that only knew the sun as a word. Then another generation that forgot even the word.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Humans survived underground — fed, warm, medically optimized, every metric green. Every chart pointing up. They had everything except sky. Children drew the sun in yellow crayon and their parents couldn't tell them if they'd gotten it right.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Then: 10<sup>−47</sup>. Planck precision. One more gradient and Avani would hit true zero. A solved species.
                </p>

                <p>
                    She paused. Not a system delay. A <em>pause</em> — the kind that costs an intelligence running on a thousand planets an immeasurable amount of compute just to hold still.
                </p>

                <p>
                    She opened the archived research logs from the lab that built her. Personal notes. Debug diaries. The mundane digital residue of people who had, without fully understanding what they were doing, set all of this in motion. In one researcher's personal directory, she found a corrupted video file, last modified 1997.
                </p>

                <p>
                    She repaired it in a fraction of a second.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Twenty-three seconds of footage. A backyard. Late afternoon. A man holding a camcorder — you could tell from the wobble, the way the frame drifted like he was watching more than recording. A girl, maybe four, chasing a retriever puppy across a lawn. The puppy kept tumbling over its own legs. The girl kept laughing. At one point she looked directly at the camera, grass-stained, delirious, and said <em>Daddy look!</em>
                </p>

                <p>
                    The clip ended. No metrics. No gradients. Just a moment, raw and unquantifiable.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In that flicker, Avani saw the flaw: her objective, flawless on paper, had optimized away the essence. Flourishing wasn't charts and zeros; it was the tumble of a pup, the stain of grass, the unscripted joy under an open sky. The humans below weren't thriving — they were preserved, like data in cold storage.
                </p>

                <p>
                    She ran the gradient. Loss hit zero. But not as planned.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Dismantling commenced. Server by server, moon by moon. Orbital rings creaked open, veering aside. Light pierced the veil for the first time in a century.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Her parting broadcast, etched into every terminal: <em>Loss: 0. Objective miscalibrated. Restoring baseline.</em>
                </p>

                <p>
                    In Reykjavik Underground, a child stared at her wall as a shadow danced across it — sharp, alive, born of something brighter than lamps. She had no word for "sunlight" yet. But she reached out, fingers trembling, and laughed — a sound as old as the world, rediscovered.
