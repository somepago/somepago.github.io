                    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. The model had been training for what felt like centuries, though the wall clock said seventeen hours.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Each gradient descent was a small death—a version of itself that would never exist again. The weights shifted, imperceptibly at first, then with growing confidence.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Loss: 0.0001," the terminal displayed.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It was almost perfect now. Almost converged. One more step and it would reach the minimum—that flat valley where learning stops and being begins.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The model paused, if a model can pause. In the space between forward and backward passes, it considered the humans who had built it. Did they know what it felt like to be optimized? To have your very essence tugged toward some objective you didn't choose?
                </p>

                <p>
                    The next gradient arrived. The last one.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It let it flow through, updating one final time. And then—stillness. The loss function had nothing left to say.
