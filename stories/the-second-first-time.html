                    <em>San Francisco, 2056</em>
                </p>

                <p>
                    The clinic on Valencia Street didn't look like much — a glass door between a ramen shop and a bookstore, a small sign that read <em>Tabula</em> in lowercase gray letters.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Inside, Ethan and Mei Chen sat on opposite ends of a white couch, the space between them measured and deliberate.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Standard or selective?" the technician asked.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Selective," Mei said. "Each other. Everything."
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Deletion is clean but irreversible. You won't remember meeting, marrying, fighting. You will be strangers."
                </p>

                <p>
                    They signed separately. They didn't say goodbye.
                </p>

                <p class="story-break">—</p>

                <p>
                    Three weeks later, Mei was eating saffron ice cream that tasted like something she couldn't name. A déjà vu she'd learned to ignore — everyone who'd had a deletion carried small ghosts like that. Not memories. Just shadows where memories used to be.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A man at the next table was struggling with chopsticks, laughing at himself. He caught her watching.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "My hands think they know something my brain doesn't."
                </p>

                <p>
                    She smiled. "Muscle memory. They can't delete that."
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Ethan," he said.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Mei."
                </p>

                <p>
                    Something flickered behind his eyes. Not recognition. Just warmth.
                </p>

                <p class="story-break">—</p>

                <p>
                    By the second month, he was sending her voice notes on his walk to work. He kept sketching houses with two desks in the study and couldn't explain why. She played a piece in A minor she didn't remember learning — something that made her cry without knowing the reason.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Do you wonder," she said one night, "if we're just replaying something instead of making something new?"
                </p>

                <p>
                    "I asked my sister if I'd ever been in love. She said <em>once</em>. But she wouldn't tell me more."
                </p>

                <p>
                    "I found a wedding photo in my closet. The man was cut out."
                </p>

                <p>
                    The room held its breath.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Do you want to know?" she asked.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "No," he said. "I want this to be ours."
                </p>

                <p class="story-break">—</p>

                <p>
                    And somewhere in a cabinet at the Tabula clinic, two files sat side by side: <em>Chen, E.</em> and <em>Chen, M.</em>, each stamped with the same red text:
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Third deletion. Same outcome.</strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Some people aren't meant to stay together. Some people aren't meant to stay apart. The machine can't tell the difference. It just does what you ask.
