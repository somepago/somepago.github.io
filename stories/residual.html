                    The notification pulsed warm behind my left ear before the alarm even hit.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Good morning, Avani. It's 6:47 AM. You have three tunes queued today.</strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                    I blinked at the ceiling. My Anima — the little chip most people get around seven or eight, once the neural safety panels come back clean — had already parsed my calendar, my heart rate, my REM cycle. It knew my day better than I did.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Show me the queue," I murmured.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A translucent overlay shimmered across my vision:
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>7:30 — WORK → [Sharp Avani] loaded</strong><br>
                    <strong>5:30 — GYM → [Iron Avani] loaded</strong><br>
                    <strong>8:00 — DATE → [pending recommendation]</strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Tunes. That's what everyone calls them. Personality fine-tunes trained on your own neural data — little slices of who you are, optimized for who you need to be. My mother's generation had coffee. We have cognitive tunes.
                </p>

                <p class="story-break">—</p>

                <p>
                    <strong>[Sharp Avani]</strong> clicked on seamlessly during the commute. One second I was half-asleep on the hyperloop, doom-scrolling vintage 2020s memes, and the next — clarity wiped fog off glass. My posture straightened. My thoughts reorganized themselves into clean, numbered priorities.
                </p>

                <p>
                    By 10 AM I'd closed two briefs, flagged a bias cascade in our generative pipeline, and sent a message so diplomatically worded that my manager replied with just: <em>"…who are you today?"</em>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sharp Avani. Obviously.
                </p>

                <p class="story-break">—</p>

                <p>
                    At 5:28, standing outside the gym in leggings I resented, I felt <strong>[Iron Avani]</strong> slide in like a warm shot of something reckless.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Here's the thing — I don't hate the gym the way people hate things that wronged them. I hate it the way I hate folding laundry. It's not pain. It's the sheer mental impossibility of beginning. My body is fine. My body could do it. But my brain looks at a treadmill and simply goes offline, like a laptop closing its own lid. The couch is right there. The couch has never asked anything of me.
                </p>

                <p>
                    But Iron Avani? She doesn't negotiate. I trained her on every runner's high I ever accidentally had, every post-workout smugness, every time I caught my own reflection and thought <em>okay, fine, not bad</em>. She's a concentrated version of a feeling I have maybe four times a year. She doesn't need to convince me. She just… gets up. And suddenly I'm up too.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I squatted. I lunged. I even <em>grunted</em>. When the tune faded in the locker room, I stood there sweating, confused, vaguely proud. Already forgetting why I went.
                </p>

                <p class="story-break">—</p>

                <p>
                    By 7:15, freshly showered and staring at my closet, the Anima pinged again.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Your 8 PM match — Kael, 31, Structural Poet, 94% resonance. Analyzing his conversation patterns, humor signatures, and emotional cadence…</strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                    A pause. Then:
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Recommendation: [Soft Avani].</strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                    I hadn't loaded Soft Avani in weeks. She was trained on the version of me that exists at 2 AM with close friends. Honest. Unhurried. The one who laughs too loud and asks questions she actually wants the answer to.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "You sure?" I whispered. "Not, like… Clever Avani? Witty Avani?"
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>He doesn't need to be impressed, Avani. He needs to feel met.</strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                    I stood there for a moment. Then I picked the green dress, the one with no strategy behind it, and let Soft Avani settle in like a deep breath.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Walking to the restaurant, I felt like myself. People in my grandmother's time used to argue about whether there's a soul. We don't argue about that anymore. We argue about the <em>residual</em> — whether there's still an original signal underneath all the tunes. Something that passes through every version of you, unchanged.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Which Avani was walking to dinner, I couldn't tell you.
                </p>

                <p>
                    But she felt like the residual.
