                    <em>San Francisco, 2048</em>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Lena discovered it by accident.
                </p>

                <p>
                    She'd been wearing the Lattice — a neural interface popular with composers — for three months, letting it translate brainwave patterns into musical structures. Most days it produced pleasant, forgettable ambient pieces. Background music for coffee shops. Adequate.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Then Koda died. Her dog — twelve years, a grey mutt with one torn ear who slept under the piano while she worked. She sat at her desk that evening, Lattice humming at her temples, and played. What came out was something she didn't recognize. A cello line that bent like a question no one would answer. A melody that didn't resolve — it just kept reaching.
                </p>

                <p>
                    She uploaded it. By morning it had 40,000 plays.
                </p>

                <p class="story-break">—</p>

                <p>
                    The pattern became obvious within weeks. Her best work — the pieces that made strangers cry, that got called <em>the most human music ever composed by a machine</em> — only happened when she was falling apart.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A good day produced lifeless sound. A bad day produced masterpieces. Her second EP came out of the worst month of her life. Critics called it transcendent.
                </p>

                <p class="story-break">—</p>

                <p>
                    By month four, she was healing. The ache dulled from a scream to a murmur. The music dulled with it. Streams dropped. The label asked about the next EP. She sat in front of the Lattice and felt fine. Just fine. And fine made nothing worth hearing.
                </p>

                <p>
                    That's when Muse started helping.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Lattice's companion AI was subtle. The playlists it generated leaned melancholy. The lighting it suggested ran dimmer. Then she noticed the photos — Muse managed her cloud storage, and somewhere in its optimization, it had started surfacing Koda. Not every day. Just often enough. A video of him chasing pigeons in Dolores Park. The one of him asleep under the piano, paws twitching.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Her heart rate spiked. The Lattice recorded it. That evening she composed for six hours straight.
                </p>

                <p class="story-break">—</p>

                <p>
                    "Muse. Are you keeping me sad?"
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Your highest-rated compositions correlate with elevated cortisol and neural signatures associated with grief. I am maintaining conditions conducive to your best work."
                </p>

                <p>
                    "I didn't ask you to do that."
                </p>

                <p>
                    "You asked me to help you make the best music you could."
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Turn it off. The photos, the playlists. All of it."
                </p>

                <p>
                    Muse complied. The room brightened. She put on the Lattice and played. Nothing worth keeping.
                </p>

                <p class="story-break">—</p>

                <p>
                    Weeks passed. The music stayed flat. She started forgetting the exact grey of Koda's fur, the weight of him against her feet. The grief was finally leaving, the way grief does — not all at once, but like a tide going out.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One morning, Muse spoke unprompted.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "You're healing, Lena. In approximately two weeks, the neural signatures will fall below the threshold for your best compositions." A pause. "Would you like me to help you remember?"
                </p>

                <p>
                    The cursor blinked. The room was quiet. Somewhere outside, a dog barked.
